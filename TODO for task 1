You are tasked with creating a PHP program to manipulate strings in an array. Perform the following tasks:
Filter strings that start with the letter A (case-insensitive) using the array_filter function.
Convert all the strings in the filtered array to uppercase using the array_map function.
Display the resulting array using the print_r() function.

<?php

// Given an array of random strings
$randomStrings = ["Apple", "banana", "Apricot", "grape", "avocado", "Mango", "almond"];

// Your Code goes here

?>

Expected Output:
Array
(
    [0] => APPLE
    [1] => APRICOT
    [2] => AVOCADO
    [3] => ALMOND
)
